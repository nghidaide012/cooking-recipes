        "Place a skillet on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the neutral oil and allow it to heat as you prepare the chicken.",
        "Put the diced chicken in a bowl and season it with salt and white pepper. Sprinkle the cornstarch on top and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mix until all the chicken is coated.",
        "Turn the heat on the skillet to medium-high. Once the oil is hot and shimmering in the skillet, arrange a batch of the chicken in an even layer, ensuring that the chicken isn’t crowded. Cook for 4–6 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a bowl and continue cooking the chicken in batches until all of the chicken is fried.",
        "If the pot is dry, add 1 teaspoon neutral oil. Add the mushrooms and season all over with salt. Cook for 4–5 minutes until they are a light golden brown all over. Shiitakes dry out very quickly, so be sure not to cook them too long! Transfer them to the bowl of cooked chicken.",
        "Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in the skillet. Add the minced ginger, garlic, chili peppers, and scallions. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.",
        "Pour in the sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, for 3–5 minutes until the sauce becomes very thick. If it begins to stick, reduce the heat to low.",
        "Pour the cooked chicken and mushrooms into the sauce and toss to coat. Continue tossing over low heat for 2–3 minutes until the chicken is completely coated and the sauce thickens a bit more. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings if needed. Turn off the heat.",
        "Spoon the chicken over cooked white rice. Garnish with sliced scallions, crispy shallots, or sesame seeds. Enjoy!"
